# Premier League Info app

## Purpose
This app is a portal for finding information about the English premier league.

The purpose of this app is to provide a destination for anybody looking for information about the English premier league.
The purpose of building this app was a first foray into a group project, where teamwork was essential to the success of the project. The app has 2 API'S which pulls in information that is requested by the user. The app makes use of modals rather than alerts to provide info. 


We created this repository to hold the submission for the week9 group-project challenge which was to create a a web application that uses 2 different apis, local storage and also a bootstrap Modal. This task helped us really grasp how to work with 3rd party api's and how to read, extrapolate and display information from them, we also learnt about workflow as a group using Git for project management. As a group we combined our knowledge and worked together to plan, execute and finalise our project.
